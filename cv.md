# About
Since joining Acer, I have been involved in Android application development, primarily responsible for collecting user experience data on Acer smartphones. This includes analyzing the usage frequency of various software and log analysis. These data are uploaded to GCS and then transferred to the company's Hadoop cluster for big data analysis through Hadoop's Oozie scheduling workflow. I also designed the API interface for the backend Google App Engine. Additionally, I participated in the development of the Acer DADA project, which assists customers in performing software updates without using the Google Play Store.

Around 2019, I began delving into the field of deep learning. My work mainly involves training FaceID models, object detection models, object segmentation models, speech recognition, and designing models for emotion and age analysis.

I have particular experience in model compression; for example, when designing a dangerous shoe detection model for the Taipei Metro, I compressed the original model to run on hardware at more than half the cost while achieving better accuracy.

Moreover, I helped the team introduce and implement CI/CD processes. Improving team efficiency is one of my interests.

I am a person who loves to constantly explore, enjoys breaking existing frameworks, creating more efficient workflows, and is passionate about academic research and practical application.
