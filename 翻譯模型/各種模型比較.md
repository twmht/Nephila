Yes, there are open-source models that may provide faster inference than NLLB (No Language Left Behind) while still supporting multiple languages. Below are some alternatives:

---

### **1. [M2M-100 (Many-to-Many Multilingual Translation)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_418M)**

- **Description**: Another model from Facebook AI, M2M-100, is optimized for many-to-many translation tasks. It's smaller and generally faster than NLLB while still supporting a wide range of languages.
- **Pros**:
    - Supports 100+ languages for direct translation without needing an English intermediary.
    - Lighter variants (e.g., 418M parameters) are faster.
- **Cons**:
    - Slightly less accurate than NLLB for low-resource languages.
- **Use Case**: Faster translations for many languages with reasonable quality.

### **2. [MarianMT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/marian.html)**

- **Description**: A family of multilingual machine translation models based on the Marian NMT framework. These models are fast and lightweight, with many pretrained versions available for specific language pairs.
- **Pros**:
    - Optimized for speed and lightweight inference.
    - Supports many predefined language pairs.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires separate models for different language pairs.
    - May not support as many languages as NLLB or M2M-100.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring specific language pairs with fast and efficient inference.

### **3. [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indicTrans2)**

- **Description**: A multilingual translation model focused on Indian languages but also supports global languages.
- **Pros**:
    - Lightweight and faster than NLLB.
    - Excellent for low-resource Indian languages.
- **Cons**:
    - Limited support for global languages compared to NLLB or M2M-100.
- **Use Case**: Fast translations for Indian and global languages.

### **4. [T5 Multilingual Variants](https://huggingface.co/models?search=t5-multilingual)**

- **Description**: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) has multilingual variants like `mT5` and `ByT5`, which can be fine-tuned for translation tasks.
- **Pros**:
    - Flexible: Can be used for other text tasks besides translation.
    - Supports a large number of languages.
- **Cons**:
    - Translation performance may require additional fine-tuning.
- **Use Case**: Multilingual NLP pipelines requiring both translation and other tasks.

---

### **5. OpenNMT (Framework)**

- **Description**: OpenNMT is a highly efficient and flexible open-source neural machine translation framework. It allows you to train custom translation models and supports multiple languages.
- **Pros**:
    - Optimized for custom training and fast inference.
    - Can leverage quantization and pruning for even faster results.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires training data if pretrained models are not available for your use case.
- **Use Case**: Custom multilingual translation pipelines with a focus on speed.

### **6. [OPUS-MT](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP)**

- **Description**: Based on the MarianMT framework, OPUS-MT models provide pretrained translation models for hundreds of language pairs.
- **Pros**:
    - Highly optimized for specific language pairs.
    - Lightweight and fast inference.
- **Cons**:
    - Separate models for each language pair.
    - Less flexibility for adding new languages.
- **Use Case**: Fast translation for predefined language pairs.

---

### **7. [AlphaTensor](https://deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphatensor) (Experimental)**

- **Description**: While not a dedicated translation model, AlphaTensor is designed for efficient tensor operations, which can be integrated into translation tasks to accelerate matrix-heavy computation.
- **Pros**:
    - Optimized for computation-heavy workloads.
- **Cons**:
    - Requires integration into existing models for language translation.
- **Use Case**: Optimization of existing translation workflows.
